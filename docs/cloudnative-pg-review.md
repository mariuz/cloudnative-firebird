# CloudNativePG review (1.28 – 1.30.1)

cloudnative-firebird follows [CloudNativePG](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg)
where Firebird allows it. This review walks through the CloudNativePG changes from 1.28.0
(December 2025) to 1.30.1 (September 23, 2026), based on the release notes in
`docs/src/release_notes/` and the fencing documentation (`docs/src/fencing.md`), and records what
each change means for this operator.

Status: **done** (in this repository), **planned** (listed in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) or
[TODO.md](../TODO.md)), **aligned** (already equivalent), **n/a** (no Firebird counterpart).

## Adopted in this round

| CloudNativePG | Here | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Fencing through `cnpg.io/fencedInstances` (a JSON list of instance names, `["*"]` for all) | `firebird.cloudnative-firebird.io/fencedInstances`, same format. The Firebird server is the container's main process, so instead of stopping it the database is put into full shutdown (`gfix -shut full` through the service manager); the pod keeps running, is not Ready, and no failover happens | done |
| 1.30: the `Cluster` scale subresource exposes `status.selector` for HPA / VPA | `labelSelectorPath: .status.selector` on the `FirebirdCluster` scale subresource | done |
| 1.30: the `cluster` reference of `ScheduledBackup`, `Database` and similar resources is immutable (CEL rule) | `clusterName` is immutable on `FirebirdBackup`, `FirebirdScheduledBackup`, `FirebirdRestore` and `FirebirdUser` | done |
| 1.28: `alpha.cnpg.io/unrecoverable` (delete a replica's pod and PVCs, recreate it) | `firebird.cloudnative-firebird.io/reseed=true` on a replica pod (v0.12.0): the data is discarded and re-seeded from a ready replica, keeping the PVC (a StatefulSet recreates the pod immediately, so deleting its claim can deadlock) and the security database | done |
| `primaryUpdateStrategy` (`unsupervised` / `supervised`) and `primaryUpdateMethod` (`restart` / `switchover`): rolling updates restart the replicas first and the primary last | Same fields (v0.15.0). With replication the StatefulSet uses `OnDelete` and the operator restarts one instance at a time; automatic failover waits for a primary restarted by the update | done |
| 1.29: Kubernetes events during reconciliation; 1.30: `PrimaryStatusCheckFailed` warning event | Events on clusters, backups, restores and users (v0.16.0); `PrimaryNotReady` when the primary stops being ready (with automatic failover enabled), aggregated like client-go | done |
| 1.30: `DatabaseRole` CRD with `databaseRoleReclaimPolicy: retain \| delete` | `FirebirdUser` (v0.12.0): Secret-backed password, `active`, `admin`, role grants, `reclaimPolicy`. Firebird users live in per-instance security databases, so they are applied to every instance; the security database was moved onto the instance volume first | done |

## Planned

| CloudNativePG | What it means here |
|---|---|
| 1.30: primary `Lease` as a promotion mutex; the instance must hold it before acting as primary, and releases it on clean shutdown | Planned switchover (v0.13.0) and automatic failover (v0.14.0) move the `<cluster>-lease` to the promoted instance. The instances do not hold or renew it yet, so it is not a promotion mutex in CloudNativePG's sense (TODO.md, "Failover safety"). |
| 1.29: shared `serviceAccountName` for workload identity (IRSA, Workload Identity) | Backup, restore and archive Jobs require an S3 `secretRef` today; a service account would allow cloud credentials without static keys. |
| 1.29: `cnpg.io/reconciliationDisabled` on backups | Per-resource pause for `FirebirdBackup` / `FirebirdScheduledBackup` (clusters already have `spec.suspended`). |
| 1.28: pod `securityContext` and per-container `containerSecurityContext` | Needs checking against the official image, whose entrypoint starts as root. |
| 1.30 security: operator-to-instance calls authenticated with a client certificate | The segment server authenticates with the SYSDBA password over plain TCP inside the cluster; see "Encrypt segment shipping" in TODO.md. |

## Already aligned

| CloudNativePG | Here |
|---|---|
| 1.30: validation during reconciliation when admission webhooks are unavailable, surfaced in status | There is no webhook: the CRDs reject invalid specs with CEL rules (v0.17.0), and every reconcile still validates the spec (and the fencing annotation) and reports `Degraded` with the message. |
| 1.29: "terminal error" phase for doomed backups | Invalid backup specs and failed Jobs end in `Failed` and are not retried. |
| 1.28: standard `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels | Used on every generated resource. |
| 1.28: replicas detect network drops within 5 s (`tcp_user_timeout`) | The segment puller uses 10 s connect and 60 s read timeouts and polls every 5 s. |
| 1.30: stable instance serials | StatefulSet ordinals are stable by construction. |

## Not applicable

- PgBouncer / `Pooler` features (image catalogs, TLS settings, `auth_user`, metrics): Firebird has
  no pooler in this operator.
- `pg_upgrade` major upgrades and extension images: Firebird upgrades go through
  `gbak` backup and restore; tracked with bootstrap/restore.
- `search_path` pinning (CVE-2026-55769), SCRAM password encoding (CVE-2026-55765), TLS client
  certificates for roles, `pg_hba` pod selectors: PostgreSQL-specific. Firebird client access is
  restricted by the generated NetworkPolicy.
- Quorum-based failover (1.28): depends on synchronous replication, which is not supported yet.
- Barman Cloud plugin migration: backups here run as Jobs with a configurable S3 client image
  (`s3.clientImage`), so the transport is already outside the operator image.
